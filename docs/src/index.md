# VectorEnumeration.jl

A [Julia](https://julialang.org) package for constructing matrix representations of finitely presented algebras over fields using vector enumeration.

--- 

## Installation
VectorEnumeration.jl is no registered package yet and therefore must be installed from sources.

## Introduction
VectorEnumeration.jl is an implementation of the vector enumeration algorithm, as presented by S.A. Linton in [[1]](@ref refs) and [[2]](@ref refs), and is based on the [latest available version](https://github.com/gap-packages/ve) of the authors implementation from 1996.
